# SixthChallenge

This project was made for the sixth challenge of Applaudo Studio's Trainee Program.

It's an angular project, divided in two main sectiosn;

    The vehicles section, which provides a series of dropdowns, with diferent vehicles inside of them.

    The form section, which consists of a form, with validation, which upon proper submission prints its values to the console, and displays them in a modal for the user to see.

Also, the project has a simple footer, and a navbar with primitive routing capabilities.
